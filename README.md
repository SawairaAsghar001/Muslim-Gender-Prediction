#Gender Detection from Names Using Machine Learning
Description: This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the gender (male or female) based solely on a given name. The dataset used includes a collection of Arabic names labeled with corresponding genders. The model applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques, particularly character-level n-gram vectorization, to convert names into features. Various machine learning algorithms were evaluated to find the best model for this classification task.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring correct data encoding.
Feature Extraction: Used CountVectorizer with character-level n-grams to capture patterns in names. Additional features, such as name length, were considered to improve prediction accuracy.
Class Imbalance Handling: Applied the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset, as it initially had more female names than male names.
Modeling: Implemented and compared different machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Random Forest with class weights performed best in handling class imbalance and yielded better accuracy.
Cross-Validation and Evaluation: Used cross-validation to evaluate model performance and ensure generalization. Achieved over 85% accuracy on balanced test data.
Tools and Technologies:

Python: For data processing, model building, and evaluation.
Pandas: To manipulate and clean the dataset.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and vectorization.
Imbalanced-learn: For handling imbalanced data using SMOTE.
Joblib: To save and load the trained models for future predictions.
Outcome: The final model achieved an accuracy of approximately 85%, providing a reliable prediction of gender based on a given name. The project showcases skills in data preprocessing, NLP, machine learning model development, and handling class imbalance issues.

Future Improvements: Further refinements can include exploring deep learning techniques and using more sophisticated features or larger datasets to improve accuracy and generalizability.
